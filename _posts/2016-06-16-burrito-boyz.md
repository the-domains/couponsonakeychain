In my 34 years of making coupons for clients, NEVER have I had such a
great response from consumers about a food coupon. And that coupon is: 
Ta-Da! Burrito Boyz.

The comments I've gotten are incredible to say the least; such as:  
It's the "best Burrito there is"  
It's "really big and filling"  
"Huge"  
"Fantastic"  
"Awesome" about 50 times.  
"Since I tasted my first Burrito Boyz it's the only Burrito I eat"  
"Burrito Boyz or nothing else"  
I think you get the idea.

What more can I really write after these comments? So you can take 
the word of literally dozens of consumers who've raved about this 
fantastic product!  
You can save up to $5.00 or up to 50% off on a Burrito Boyz burrito. Or 
you can have a free salsa with chips when you buy a Burrito Boyz 
burrito. Save $2.00
